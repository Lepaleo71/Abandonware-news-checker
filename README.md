# Abandonware-news-checker
Made this quikly to keep myself busy, I don't remember what work, what doesn't, just pushing that if someone wants it. 
It's called owlcat somewhere because the original placeholder picture is a chinese meme of an owl with a cat head.

## What it does
- Checks the current site against a local JSON of NewsGuard scores (French media as examples).
- If the score is low, it shows a small panel with three buttons:
  - Why? → Explains why the site got flagged.
  - Compare → Suggests other sources covering the same topic that are rated higher.
  - Ignore → Lets you silence the assistant.

- Appears only when needed or when invoked manually.
- Nothing is stored long-term: no history, no cookies, no trackers.

Why should you care? Probably shouldn't. It's experimental, not finished and I'm not going to maintain it, do whatever you want.

Disclaimer: I don't even know if it works, and I know it's probably not even half accurate. 
Use it at your own risk, I won't take any responsibility. The comments are translated in English from French, it's probably sketchy.
