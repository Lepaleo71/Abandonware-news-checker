Made this quickly to keep myself busy. It's called owlcat somewhere, because the placeholder picture is an owl with a cat head. GNU GPL v3. I don't know if it works, and I know it's probably not even half accurate. Use it at your own risk, I won't take any responsibility. The comments are translated from French, it's probably sketchy.
